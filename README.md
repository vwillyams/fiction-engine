# fiction-engine

Sliiiightly abandoned project, this is a game engine focused on procedural generation of interesting stories. This section is just the engine, actual interactivity is to come later.

Outstanding issues:
* The randomization component needs a complete overhaul - currently it functions but it will not scale well, and since this is the core of the engine it would be best t do it right.
